# WebScraping-Local-Website

In this code we are fetching information from a local website about job listing available, filters them out according to skills and saves the output
in a local file

This program is able to fetch the: 
* Job Title/Role needed
* list all skills needed for the specific job
* A link for the job application   

The code is also able to filter out unwanted skills so that you get job listings related to a particular skill set

### Packages used
- BeautifulSoup
- requests 

### Challenges encountered: 
- The only maim challenge encountered was trying to find the exact elements that would relay the information back correctly (find element by ID, x-path, class and find_all)
- In overall it was a nice practice on webscrapping bit and an educative one too  


Enjoy Coding ‚ù§
